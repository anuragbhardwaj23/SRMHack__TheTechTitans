The machine learning model is responsible for recognizing and identifying individuals based on their facial features. It is trained using the captured dataset, which includes images of individuals with their respective labels. The training process involves extracting meaningful patterns and creating a model capable of distinguishing between different individuals.

Once the model is trained, it is integrated into the website's backend. When an individual marks their attendance, the website captures their image through the webcam. The model then processes this image and compares it with the existing database of individuals' facial features.

By comparing the captured image with the stored data, the model determines whether the person marking their attendance is available in the database or not. If the model identifies a match, access is granted, and the attendance is marked. Otherwise, access is denied, indicating that the person is not present in the database.

The website's frontend provides an intuitive user interface that allows individuals to interact with the attendance system. It may include features like a webcam preview, a button to mark attendance, and notifications indicating the access granted or denied status.

Overall, this attendance website combines computer vision, machine learning, and web development technologies to automate the attendance process. By leveraging facial recognition techniques, it improves efficiency, accuracy, and security in tracking and managing attendance records.
